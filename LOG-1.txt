Project Idea:

Based on the game War:

Our idea is a strategy game.
The ultimate goal is to conquer more of the board in the time limit.

The starting position is in the corners for four players or left/right 
for two players.

This game requires tactical decisions to either capture or build troops
to strengthen yourself before fighting.
